# AI-Powered Game Development Framework

This project is an AI-powered game development framework built using Pygame. It provides a set of tools, utilities, and a modular structure to facilitate the creation of games with the assistance of AI technology. The framework is designed to be easily integrated into AI coding tools and chatbots, enabling users to generate custom games based on their requirements.

## Features
### Game Scenes
The framework includes various game scenes such as the start screen, spaceship selection, main game, and game over screen. These scenes can be easily customized or extended to suit different game genres and styles.
### Game Objects
The framework defines several game objects like the player, NPCs (non-player characters), and bullets. These objects have their own properties, behaviors, and collision detection mechanisms, making it easier to create interactive and dynamic game elements.
### Shared Utilities
The framework provides a set of shared utilities for handling game settings, grid layout, font loading, and UI elements like info boxes and breathing text effects. These utilities streamline the game development process and promote code reusability.
### Asset Management
The project includes a structured approach to managing game assets such as images, audio files, and fonts. This makes it easier to organize and access game resources during development.
### AI Tools and Abilities
The framework incorporates AI tools and capabilities to enhance the game development process. For example, content generation tools can be used to create game assets, levels, or storylines based on user input or predefined templates. AI algorithms can also be employed to generate intelligent game behaviors or optimize game performance.
### Game Reloading
The framework includes a game reloader that automatically detects changes in the game files and reloads the game without manual intervention. This feature enhances the development workflow and allows for quick iterations.


## Getting Started

To get started with the AI-powered game development framework, follow these steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/aviosipov/sb-ai-vision-demo.git
cd sb-ai-vision-demo
cd pygame-demos
pip install -r requirements.txt
python game_runner.py
```


- Explore the pygame-demos folder to understand the structure and components of the framework.
- Customize and extend the game scenes, objects, and utilities to suit your game requirements.
- Integrate AI tools and capabilities into your game development process to generate content, optimize gameplay, or create intelligent behaviors.
- Run the game using the provided game runner or integrate it into your AI coding tools or chatbots.
